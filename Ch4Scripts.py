# Chapter 4
# Interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3 to 4 lines long
# Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file
# In a sentence we are "giving Python a Script"
# As a conversation, we add ".py" as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python programs.
